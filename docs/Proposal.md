## 2. Background

-	**What is it about?**
  - The U.S. Census Bureau collects income-related data for all Americans on an annual basis through surveys like the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplements (CPS ASEC). This data is gathered and related every September.
 	
- **Why does it matter?**
  - This data can be used to track economic trends. As we have all experienced, the United States has faced inflation following the pandemic. Collecting income data annually is crucial because it allows the government, researchers, and economists to monitor and analyze trends in household income, earnings, and inequality over time. 
  - Monitoring income data is essential as it forms a fundamental component in calculating the official poverty rate in the United States. This calculation can assist in planning future government funding for various assistance programs.
    - Income data is frequently employed in demographic analyses to comprehend income trends among different age groups, genders, races, and geographic locations.
    - Both the United States government and businesses can use historical income data to make forecasts and develop strategic plans for preparing for future economic changes.
    -  Lastly, being transparent with citizens fosters greater public awareness when they are making income-related decisions for their households.
    
-	**What are your research questions?**
  -	We can determine the highest and lowest income earned by using features such as education level, age, work class, and location.
  -	We can determine the hours per week for each income bracket.
  -	We can predict the real median household income for next year.
  - We can predict the real lower household income for next year.
