2. Background
Provide the background information about the chosen topic.
•	What is it about? 
In 1998, the Social Security Administration released Actuarial Note #139, authored by actuary Michael W. Shackleford, providing an analysis of the distribution of given names among Social Security number holders.  The Actuarial Note #139 has become a valuable resource for studying name distribution within the United States.  All data utilized by the Social Security website is sourced from a 100% sample of records pertaining to SSN applications. 
•	Why does it matter? 
Becoming parents is very exciting. However, naming a newborn baby could be somewhat difficult, and this is significant for several reasons:
Societal Understanding: Researching name distribution trends offers insights into cultural and societal changes over time, reflecting cultural and generational shifts.
Demographic Research: The name data is valuable for demographic research, aiding policymakers in tracking population dynamics and migration patterns.
Public Policy: Government and local organizations can utilize this name data to inform policies related to social services, education, and marketing strategies based on the demographics associated with names.
•	What are your research questions?
What is the most popular baby boy name/ girl name?
