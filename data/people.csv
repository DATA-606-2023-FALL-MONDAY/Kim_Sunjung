63441,Kim Chang-wan,"Kim Chang Wan is a South Korean rock singer, composer, musician, actor, TV host, radio DJ, writer, and poet. Kim, along with his younger brothers Kim Chang Hoon and Kim Chang Ik, began composing music during their mid-teens and formed the band ""Mui"" when they were college students.

After Kim graduated in 1975 from Seoul National University, they went professional and changed their band's name to Sanulrim (meaning ""Mountain Echo""). The band's psychedelic rock/hard rock sound (reminiscent of the Sex Pistols) was music Koreans hadn't heard before, and Sanulrim revitalized the Korean music scene, which was currently devastated after several major musicians were arrested for marijuana possession in the 1970s.

They held a 30th-anniversary concert in 2007 and made plans to release the 14th album. But drummer Kim Chang Ik was killed in a traffic accident in Vancouver, Canada on January 29th, 2008, and Sanulrim disbanded after his death.

Having worked as a music director and film score composer in the early 1990s, Kim also began acting onscreen. He did not only starred in movies such as Blades of Blood, Antique Bakery, Shinsukki Blues, Windstruck, and My Love Ssagajy but also in roughly 30 television shows.

The versatile Kim has also starred in a stage play (A Nap in 2010), hosted variety shows and radio programs, and written several books (some containing poetry).",South Korea,22/02/1954,,2,Acting,5.312,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/3eAE5sDQEM4gUN7AMUEkjHduDAe.jpg

The next year brought with it the opportunity to feature in a Samsung commercial and then an acting debut in the TV series Dinosaur Teacher. Quickly achieving fame, she was one of Korea’s top TV stars in the mid-to-late 1990s, featuring in notable fare such as Men of the Bath House (1995), Propose (1997), Wedding Dress (1997), Mister Q (1998), which earned her top honors at the SBS Drama Awards, Sunflower (1998) and Tomato (1999).  She embarked on a dual career as a film actress starting in 1997 but failed to find quite the same level of popularity as she had on the small screen. She starred opposite JANG Dong-gun in 1997’s Repechage and then Ghost in Love (1999) from the same director. Her biggest role was in high-budget martial arts blockbuster Bichunmoo which came out in 2000. She changed her image by cutting her hair short for her next part, as an animator in the romantic comedy Wanee and Junah (2001). Her last Korean film was A Letter From Mars (2003). While she has remained active on TV, her only other film roles have been in the HK martial arts title The Myth (2005), alongside Jackie CHAN, and the Chinese period war film The Warring States (2011).","Daegu, South Korea",11/06/1977,,1,Acting,4.732,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/yquogQGc7422fAi4T6HdgNwh4yI.jpg

87553,Kim Yeo-jin,"Kim Yeo-jin (born June 24, 1972) is a South Korean actress and activist. Kim made her acting debut in the stage play What Do Women Live For in 1995, and has since remained active in film and television, drawing praise for her supporting roles in Im Sang-soo's Girls' Night Out (1998), Lee Chang-dong's Peppermint Candy (2000), and Im Kwon-taek's Chi-hwa-seon (2002).

Kim is known for being actively engaged in various rallies and civic group activities, attracting public attention to controversial social and political issues, including efforts to reinstate laid-off shipbuilders at Hanjin Heavy Industries, calls to lower university tuition fees, and opposition to the Four Major Rivers Project. She often expresses her opinions on social networking service Twitter,[8][9][10][11][12] and has been called one of the most popular socialtainers.

Because of her outspokenness, MBC banned Kim in 2011 (she was originally scheduled to appear as a ""progressive"" panelist on the current affairs radio show Sohn Suk-hee's Spotlight), which led to prominent figures from academic, literary and media circles to call for a boycott of the network's programs.

Kim has also campaigned for liberal politicians Roh Moo-hyun, Moon Jae-in and Park Won-soon.","Changwon, South Gyeongsang, South Korea",24/06/1972,,1,Acting,6.89,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/ijRex60fv0k4neHuvWxi94qHSU1.jpg

Across Asia, Jang's popularity has steadily grown, opening new doors of chance for her. She was invited to star in the Chinese TV drama, and the actress went to the mainland to participate in the international press conference.

The media gathered in close, trying not to miss a thing! The coverage had been ""hot"" since news of the drama was released.

""Miss Mermaid"", the Korean TV drama that made Asia's audience fall in love with Jang Seo-hee. It's a production that could never be overlooked in her career.

She had worked tirelessly in the drama and her hard work was not in vain. It brought her recognition as one of Korea's most talented actresses.

After ""Miss Mermaid"", the offers continued to pour in. Jang challenged herself on television to the silver screen. She didn't have a moment to catch her breath.

In the film, ""Ghost House"", she joined Cha Seung-won and played an unusual role, once again enticing her audience.

It almost seems like she was shot to stardom overnight, but that is definitely NOT the case. Her perseverance and tenacity brought her successful results, and Jang Seo-hee is grateful for that. She shared some advice with her junior actors.

She debuted in 1989 as a fledgling actress and has retained determined aspirations to this day. Jang still clings to the passion she had during her years as a rookie, letting it help lead the way into her future.

Not only is this star big in dramas and film, she's sought after constantly by marketers, for commercials and various advertisements. Even beyond Korea! Fans adore her and we're sure her male fans are curious to hear about Jang Seo-hee's IDEAL MAN.

The support of her fans has allowed her to stand as a star and Jang makes sure to share as much time as she can with them. She was all smiles during her last autograph signing event, making eye contact with each individual.

Jang will be greeting fans in the New Year with a new movie! As well as starting her journey with a pan-Asian cast in an upcoming Chinese TV drama! We hope to see fantastic results and good luck to the actress Jang Seo-hee in 2006.","Seoul, South Korea",05/01/1972,,1,Acting,1.604,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/zxjXig4bOTxPlCvfNPrcRMA4Ixl.jpg
